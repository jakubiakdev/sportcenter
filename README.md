# SportCenter

SportCenter is a small project made to learn and demonstrate the use of React Router for creating a single-page application (SPA) for e-commerce.

## Features
- Routing with React Router configured with parameters and nested routes
- User login kept across pages, with protected routes enforcing access
- Product information is being fetched from an external source that could be replaced by an API
- Tailwind CSS utilized for easier styling and code management 

## TODOs:

- [ ] This project's framework is not ideal and is deprecated (create-react-app), and should've been made with Vite or similar.
    - [ ] This also means that some imports use `../` which doesn't look so nice
- [ ] Responsive design was not a consideration for this quick and dirty project, meaning there are some problematic areas when viewed on a small screen.

## Running
To run this project locally:
```sh
npm i 
npm run start
```
